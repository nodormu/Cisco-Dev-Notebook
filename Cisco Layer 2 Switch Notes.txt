Cisco iOS Layer 2 Switch Notes
Don't forget to type:  copy run start    when you complete your changes.


1) some basic global settings (some <pseudocode> and/or <pseudocode + notes>
Google these to see which apply to your environment if they are obvious to you.

no service pad
service timestamps debug datetime localtime
service timestatmp log datetime localtime
ip dhcp snooping vlan # (whatever vlan(s) you need this on)
no ip domain-lookup (if you are not using local DNS, and don't want to wait for ever for some URL to time out)
vtp domain <type domain>
vtp mode <default is server, BE SURE YOU CHANGE YOUR vtp MODE for a new switch BEFORE connecting to your existing network otherwise, you may wipe out your entire existing VTP database on your network>
vlan internal allocation policy ascending
clock timezone UTC -5
clock summer-time UTC recurring
authentication mac-move permit
ip subnet-zero
ip domain-name <domain name.com>
switch # provision <hostname>
system mtu routing 1500 (this is default)


2) login setup

aaa new model or not, depending on your requirements. Check online based on your code version

--Other triple aaa options/commands
aaa session-id common


3) Users/admins. You want to setup local access for full priv 15 admin users in case RADIUS or AD server is unavailable

username <username> priv 15 secret 5 <type in clear text>

--Don't forget to set the enable secret, but you typically want to use RADIUS or AD for logins, rather than secret to get to enable prompt
enable secret 5 <enter in plaintext>

--Now encrypt everything
service password-encryption (run this after you setup all your local logins)

4) trustpoints, this is an example with little pseudo code

crypto pki trustpoint <certificate, self signed, domain, etc>
	enrollment <type> (could be selfsigned if you don't have a CRM)
	subject-name cn=IOS-Self-Signed-Certificate-############
	revocation-check none
	rsakeypair <certificatename> 

5) setup up logging as much or as little as you want/need/require

archive
	log config
	logging enable
	logging size ### (whatever buffer you want)
	notify syslog contenttype plaintext

--Log buffering options
logging buffered ########### (choose buffer or use default)

--Other common global logging settings to consider
service timestamps debug datetime localtime
service timestamps log datetime localtime

login on-failure log
login on-success log

6) setup spanning tree. Some older switches have limitations on the number VLANs due to lack of RAM, or lack of support to upgrade existing RAM.
rapid PVST2 is a better option if you must using spanning tree for loop avoidance on Layer 2.
Of course google your version of code for any further options/limitations

spanning-tree mode rapid-pvst
spanning-tree etherchannel guard misconfig
spanning-tree extend system-id

7) Some basic Interface configuration options for non-trunking interfaces

interface GigabitEthernet#/#/#
	description <type something useful, like Joes phone and workstation, or Room27,jack4>
	switchport access vlan #
	switchport mode access
	switchport voice vlan # (if you have a VoIP phone on this port and are using the switch on the phone to route your data traffic to the PC connected to it.)
	spanning-tree portfast (check your version of code to see if this command is even needed. May be deprecated on newer and large chassis module based switches.)
	spanning-tree bpduguard enable (check your version of code and your environment to see if this type of protection is needed)

8) Some basic Interface options for trunking interfaces

interface GigabitEthernet1/0/46
	description <type something useful like Hostname Switch, port 27>
	switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q (this may not be needed, check relative to your code version options)
	switchport mode trunk
	switchport trunk allowed vlan #, #, #  (etc, this allows you to specify what vlans are allowed across the trunk, all = default)

9) Set default gateway, along with other common global ip settings

ip default-gateway <type IP address of your default gateway>
ip classless
ip http server
ip htp secure-server

10) Set ntp server

ntp clock-period ######### (Google what is for this ##########)
ntp source <specify source interface of NTP traffic inbound to switch>
ntp server <type IP address of NTP server in your environment>

10) setup VTY inputs, example for SSH only, stay away from telnet if you can help it.

line con 0
 logging synchronous
line vty 0 4
 exec-timeout 30 0
 transport input ssh
line vty 5 15
 exec-timeout 0 0
 no exec
 transport input ssh

11) assign SSH IP access of switch to a management VLAN

interface Vlan#
	ip address <IP address> <subnet mask, not wild card>

12) Set hostname of device

hostname <type hostname of device>
